<p><strong>Data Usage</strong></p>
<p>Simply Workout is using the Apple framework called Core Data to store your data locally on your device. Simply Workout can use iCloud to securely back up your in-app preferences and make the app available on all your devices. iCloud&nbsp;encrypts your&nbsp;data when it's in&nbsp;transit, stores it in&nbsp;iCloud&nbsp;in an&nbsp;encrypted&nbsp;format, and synchronizes data between devices. Using iCloud with Simply Workout is entirely optional. You can turn iCloud off for the application and remove your data from iCloud at any time through the settings app on your devices. Furthermore, we have no access to any of your data in iCloud. Any data you store in iCloud is subject to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Customer Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
